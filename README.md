WIP: Lazily "convert" a Babylon AST to the ESTree equivalent. Currently only converts `Literal`s. For the time being, the goal of this project is only to support the bare minimum transformations needed by `webpack`.

## Changelog

See [`Releases`](https://github.com/DrewML/lazy-babylon-to-estree/releases)

## Features

* Conversions happen lazily when a property on the AST is accessed
* Original AST is not mutated (besides 1 non-enumerable, symbol-keyed prop on the `Program` node)
* Referential Equality between nodes is maintained (`===`)
* Transformations occur as other code traverses the tree (this module does not perform a separate traversal of the AST)

## Why?

This is an experiment I'm doing with `webpack` and `babel-loader` to try and prevent the double parsing of code, without having to create an entire transformed copy of the AST each time we go from `babel-loader` >> `webpack`. It's possible this will have no positive performance impact (or will even have a negative perf impact), but I'd never know if I didn't write the code ðŸ•º.

## Missing Features/TODO

* `ObjectProperty` and `ObjectMethod` >> `Property`
* `ClassMethod` >> `MethodDefinition`
